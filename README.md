**Testimonial:**

**Alan Niu:** (Change to your name)

Throughout ACTL1101, I have mastered the topics listed in principles of actuarial science, and the coding assignment work is mine. I feel much more prepared for my future career.

Over the last 10 weeks I really had a lot of fun diving into different probabilistic models that tried to predict uncertain outcomes in a rational manner. The ties between math, finance, and coding has also been uncovered and definitely solidified my determination to study actuarial science. I particularly enjoyed the recurring theme of calculating different annuities which is used in life insurance.
